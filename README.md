As organizations increasingly rely on cloud storage, managing large, diverse datasets presents significant challenges. Traditional deduplication methods, such as hash-based and block-level techniques, often fail to address the complexity and scale of modern data environments, resulting in inefficiencies, elevated storage costs, and decreased system performance [4]. This paper presents an advanced machine learning-based solution that integrates Siamese Neural Networks for precise similarity detection, Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for efficient indexing, and DBSCAN clustering to group similar files. The system supports multiple file types, including images, text, PDFs, and CSVs, enabling effective cross-format deduplication.
Tested on diverse multi-cloud environments and varied datasets, the system achieved a 50% reduction in storage usage, a near-perfect Silhouette Score of 0.999 for clustering, and Precision, Recall, and F1 Scores of 1.00 in identifying duplicates and near-duplicates. Additionally, the system employs adaptive learning capabilities to enhance deduplication accuracy as more data is processed. By combining advanced techniques, the solution significantly improves data management by optimizing storage utilization, reducing operational costs, and ensuring scalability for large-scale cloud storage infrastructures. This approach positions the system as a robust and efficient solution for modern data deduplication challenges.
